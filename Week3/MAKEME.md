   and store the unique strings in lovelyCommands.txt
```

For an overview of the commands we learned in class please take a look at the overview of the [second lecture](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/CommandLine/blob/master/Week2/Lecture.md/). If you need a refresher you can of course also go over the commands of the [first lecture](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/CommandLine/blob/master/Week1/Lecture.md/)

## Step 3: Assignment

_Deadline Saturday_

> Use the command line to create a directory "week3" inside your "hyf-html-css" directory. There should already be a "week1" and "week2" inside that contains your homework of the last weeks.

- Remake an existing responsive website: choose one of the following
  - https://www.rijksoverheid.nl
  - http://www.awwwards.com
  - https://www.bostonglobe.com
  - https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com
  - http://muumilaakso.tampere.fi/en/
  - http://incredibletypes.com
  - http://thenextweb.com
- It should have an external CSS file
- BEFORE you hand it in, read the [Style guide](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_syntax.asp) again and check your files

```
How to hand in your homework:
• Upload your homework in your Github repository.
• Make sure to create a new folder "week3" first.
• Your hyf-html-css/week3 should now contain an index.html and a main.css file (and the images folder)
• Place the link to your repository in Trello.
```
