## Homework Week 3

>[Here](https://github.com/SocialHackersCodeSchool/JavaScript/tree/master/Week0) you find the readings you have to complete before your first JavaScript lecture

### Learning goals for this week:
```
 • CLI
    • Learn output redirection, piping on the terminal.
    • Write basic shell scripts to ease the programming life.
 • Student presentations
 • Last week recap and questions
 • How to find information on the web
 • How to rebuild an existing responsive page (getting started with this week's homework exercise)
```

## Step 1: Give feedback

- In Trello you are added to one of the cards of your fellow students.
- Give feedback on the drone assignment and the command line homework of your fellow student. Please be critical but most of all give constructive feedback. If there are resources that you used and might be useful, share them.
- Revisit you own drone assignment and command line homework and improve it with the feedback and suggestions given by one of your classmates.  

## Step 2: Command Line

>We covered a bit of command line usage in the first class and got a program running which is great. If you need a refresher for the command line please have a look here: https://github.com/SocialHackersCodeSchool/CommandLine

```
Write commands to do following:
1.
Create a folder. Enter a folder. Create an empty file named blank.
2.
Then write the content `"Hello"` five times to the file greetings.txt.
Then copy the file greetings.txt and paste its contents into 1.txt, 2.txt, 3.txt, 4.txt and 5.txt.
3.
Then write the text "cat" to pets.txt
Then append the text "dog" to pets.txt
Then append the text "hamster" to pets.txt
4.
Then write the text "cat" to commands.txt
Then append the text "ls" to commands.txt
Then append the text "pwd" to commands.txt
5.
Then find unique words from these two files pets.txt and commands.txt and store the unique words in lovelyCommands.txt
```


## Step 3: Assignment

The final part of this homework is to practice HTML and CSS by making a website. You don't have to complete it, just give it your best shot!

 - Remake an existing responsive website: this one is good website to try with lots of different elements.
   - https://www.rijksoverheid.nl
   
 - If you want something a little harder you could try one of these
   - http://www.awwwards.com
   - https://www.bostonglobe.com
   - https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com
   - http://muumilaakso.tampere.fi/en/
   - http://incredibletypes.com
   - http://thenextweb.com
 - It should have an external CSS file
 - BEFORE you hand it in, read the [Style guide](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_syntax.asp) again and check your files


```
How to hand in your homework:
• Upload your homework in your Github repository.
• Make sure to create a new folder "week3" first.
• Your sha-html-css/week3 should now contain an index.html and a main.css file (and the images folder)
• Place the link to your repository in Trello.
```

## Step 4: Prepare for next class

Go trough the reading material in the JavaScript [README.md](https://github.com/SocialHackersCodeSchool/JavaScript/blob/master/Week0/README.md) to prepare for your next class
