## Step 1: Give feedback

_Deadline Monday_

- In Trello you are added to one of the cards of your fellow students.
- Give feedback on the drone assignment and the command line homework of your fellow student. Please be critical but most of all give constructive feedback. If there are resources that you used and might be useful, share them.
- Revisit you own drone assignment and command line homework and improve it with the feedback and suggestions given by one of your classmates.  


## Step 2: Assignment

_Deadline Saturday_

> Use the command line to create a directory "week3" inside your "hyf-html-css" directory. There should already be a "week1" and "week2" inside that contains your homework of the last weeks. 

 - Remake an existing responsive website: choose one of the following
   - https://www.rijksoverheid.nl
   - http://www.awwwards.com
   - https://www.bostonglobe.com
   - https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com
   - http://muumilaakso.tampere.fi/en/
   - http://incredibletypes.com
   - http://thenextweb.com
 - It should have an external CSS file
 - BEFORE you hand it in, read the [Style guide](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_syntax.asp) again and check your files


```
How to hand in your homework:
• Upload your homework in your Github repository. 
• Make sure to create a new folder "week3" first. 
• Your hyf-html-css/week3 should now contain an index.html and a main.css file (and the images folder)
• Place the link to your repository in Trello.
```
