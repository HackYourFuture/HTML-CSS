## Step 3: Assignment:

_Deadline Saturday_

> Use the command line to create a directory "week2" inside your hyf-html-css directory. There should already be a week1 inside that contains your homework of last week.

 - Grids exercise
    - Download the HTML and images in the folder Homework 2 ([or click this link to download](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/HackYourFuture/HTML-CSS/tree/master/Week2/Homework2))
    - You are going to write the CSS for this page
    - You are not allowed to change the HTML
    - The page contains two grids: the first one should work using floats, the second using flex box. Be careful not to mix the two!
    - We want the grid to look as follows (check the wireframe below):
      - On mobile phones: a two column grid, with the exception that the first item spans the full width
      - On tablets: a three column grid, with the exception that the first two items span the full width together (so first we have two columns, then after the first two items we have three columns)
      - On desktops: a four column grid, with the exception that the first item spans two columns.
    - There should be some space between the grid items
    - Make the page look beautiful by adding some more CSS! Some tips:
      - How about some nice colors, fonts, hover styles?
      - According to the grid specification, some products are bigger than others. Maybe these are "highlighted" products, so the rest of the styling could also be different.
    - BEFORE you hand it in, read [the Style guide](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_syntax.asp) again and check your files

![Wireframe](assets/wireframe.png)

```
How to hand in your homework:
• Upload your homework in your Github repository. 
• Make sure to create a new folder "week2" first. 
• Your hyf-html-css/week2 should now contain an index.html and a main.css file (and the images folder)
• Place the link to your repository in Trello.
```

## Extra extra (bonus assignment :star: ):

- Add one of the following to your page:
    - An animation using CSS keyframes
    - SVG
