## Step 4: Assignment:

 - Grids exercise
    - Download the HTML and images in the folder Homework 2 ([or click this link to download](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/SocialHackersCodeSchool/HTML-CSS/tree/master/Week2/Homework2))
    - You are going to write the CSS for this page
    - You are not allowed to change the HTML
    - We want the grid to look as follows (check the wireframe below):
      - On mobile phones: a two column grid, with the exception that the first item spans the full width
      - On tablets: a three column grid, with the exception that the first two items span the full width together (so first we have two columns, then after the first two items we have three columns)
      - On desktops: a four column grid, with the exception that the first item spans two columns.
    - There should be some space between the grid items
    - Make the page look beautiful by adding some more CSS! Some tips:
      - How about some nice colors, fonts, hover styles?
      - According to the grid specification, some products are bigger than others. Maybe these are "highlighted" products, so the rest of the styling could also be different.
    - BEFORE you hand it in, read [the Style guide](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_syntax.asp) again and check your files

• Place the link to your repository in Trello.
```
