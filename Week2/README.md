## Introduction to the Command Line

The Command Line interface (also known as CLI or shell) is the interface between you (the user) and the operating system which interprets your commands and allows the computer to respond to your command. In this module you will be introduced to the command line, in this module we will mainly use it to navigate our file system and creating files. Throughout the entire program you will have to use these skills and build on top of it.
