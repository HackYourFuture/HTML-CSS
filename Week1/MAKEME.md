# Homework HTML/CSS Week 1

## Todo list

2. CSS Challenges

4. PROJECT: Digital Resume

### 1. Command Line Interface challenge

Using the CLI, create a plain text file (`.txt`) that contains the commands necessary to answer the following questions:

1. How do I create a hidden file or folder? How do I display it in the CLI?
2. How do I create multiple nested directories, like `/c/Users/myusername/these/folders/are/just/for/fun`?
3. How do I append a message to a file, without a newline character, so the output would be:

```
first message
second message
```

### 4. PROJECT: Digital Resume

> Every week ends with a project you have to build on your own. Instead of getting clear-cut instructions, you'll get a list of criteria that your project needs to measure up to.

In the following assignment you'll make your own Digital Resume. Here are the requirements that need to be fulfilled:

-   It needs to be one webpage
-   Your project folder should contain two files: HTML and CSS
-   Include the following pieces of information:
    -   Your personal information
    -   A picture of you
    -   A few lines about who you are
    -   Education
    -   Work experience

When writing the HTML include the following:

-   Different types of headings, like `<h1>` and `<h2>`
-   An unordered list (`<ul>`). Use this to list out your educational background
-   Another unordered list (`<ul>`).
-   an `<img>` tag (for your picture)
-   some `<p>` tags

When writing the CSS include the following:

-   Some CSS properties, like: `margin`, `padding`, `color`, etc.
-   You are NOT allowed to use CSS frameworks (like Bootstrap or MaterializeCSS)

## SUBMIT YOUR HOMEWORK!

After you've finished your todo list it's time to show us what you got! The homework that needs to be submitted is the following:

1. The CLI challenge
2. The Digital Resume

Upload both in a repository to GitHub and then upload the link on Trello. Go through the [guide](../hand-in-homework-guide.md) to learn how to do this.
