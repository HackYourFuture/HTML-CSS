# Module #1 - HTML, CSS and GIT (Frontend)

![image](assets/module1.png)

Welcome to the wonderful world of web development! In this module you will learn the basic building blocks of the web: HTML and CSS. HTML gives us the power to add text, images and videos to a page. CSS gives us the power to organize these parts and make it look nice.

The products of HTML and CSS comprise a two-thirds of what is called `frontend` (the final third is client-side JavaScript, which you will learn about in later modules). What is frontend? It's another word for the presentational part of a piece of software. In terms of web development we're talking about "what you see" when you go to any website.

Think of it like this: if a webpage were a person, the HTML would be the skeleton and CSS the skin and clothing!

You'll also be learning [GIT](https//www.github.com/hackyourfuture/git), software that will allow you to save your folders and files in case they accidentally get deleted or end up corrupt. It can do much more and you'll learn all about that starting from week 2!

## Learning goals

In order to successfully complete this module you will need to master the following:

- Be able to write syntactically correct HTML and CSS
- Understand what is meant by "responsive" web development
- Practice navigation your computer using the command line interface (CLI)
- Learn about GIT and its basic usage
- Become familiar with Trello and GitHub as a way to submit your homework
- Explain your code by presenting what you've done
- Know your way around Visual Studio Code
- Feel comfortable working with your browser's inspector

## How to use this repository

This repository consists of 3 essential parts:

1. `Reading materials`: this document contains all the required theory you need to know _**while**_ you're coding. It's meant as both study material and as a reference to understand what you're doing.
2. `Homework`: this document contains the instructions for each week's homework.
3. `Lesson Plans`: this part is meant for teachers as a reference. However, as a student don't be shy to take a look at it as well!

After your first class you should start off with checking the `reading materials` for that week. At the beginning that would be the [Week 1 Reading](/Week1/README.md). Study all the concepts and try to get the gist of everything. After, you can get started with the `homework` for that week.

If you have any questions or if something is not entirely clear ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯, please ask/comment on Slack!
