            <h3>Iron Man</h3>
            <p> Tony Stark is the genius inventor/billionaire/philanthropist owner of Stark Industries. With his super high-tech Iron Man suit, he is practically indestructible, able to fly, and has a large selection of weapons to choose from - but it's Tony's quick thinking and ability to adapt and improvise that make him an effective leader of the Avengers. </p>
